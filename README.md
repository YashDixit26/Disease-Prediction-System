# 🩺 Disease Prediction System Using Patient Data

An end-to-end **Machine Learning based Intelligent Healthcare System** that predicts diseases from user-entered symptoms and provides complete medical guidance including **description, precautions, medications, diet, and workout recommendations**.

This project combines data science, machine learning, and information retrieval to simulate a real-world smart healthcare assistant.

## ✅ 1. Project Objective

The aim of this project is to build an intelligent system that:

- Predicts diseases based on patient symptoms  
- Handles medical dataset class imbalance using SMOTE  
- Uses advanced machine learning models with hyperparameter tuning  
- Supports symptom spell correction  
- Provides full disease recommendations after prediction
